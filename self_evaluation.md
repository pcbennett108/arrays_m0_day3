- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
*Very confident so far. I know that there are more advanced array methods that use inline code blocks which I don't know how to work with yet. But since that is outside the scope of todays lessons, my confidence has not waned.*

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
*No. I'm feeling good about subject.*

- What questions do you have about Arrays?
*I have questions about combining them and other advanced methods. But I don't want to get ahead of myself.*
